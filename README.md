# Cralias - a set of useful aliases for bash

**Cralias** and **Cralias Bio** are alias sets for a unix shell.

**Cralias** is a set of useful commands for the terminal, such as live file lists (`vk`), easy sandboxing (`sand`) and quick uniq (`unik`), among many many others.

Some systems may be not have all required functions built in. For full functionality;
- Make sure `watch` is installed (e.g. `brew install watch` on Mac)
- Make sure `column` is installed(e.g. on linux might need to do `apt install util-linux` and/or `apt install bsdmainutils`).
- If using zsh or a Mac, install `gfind` using `brew install findutils`.

**Cralias Bio** is a set of useful terminal commands for biologists, featuring a sample sequence generator (`ranseq*`) and fasta file viewers (`flatfa`, `flal`, `flil`), among others.

Add `source /path/to/cralias/cralias*sh` to your `bashrc` to use cralias! Information on each individual alias and function is included in the comments of each file.

If you have any suggestions for cralias commands, let me know!
