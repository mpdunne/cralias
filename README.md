# Cralias - a set of useful aliases for bash

**Cralias** and **Cralias Bio** are alias sets for a unix shell.

**Cralias** is a set of useful commands for the terminal, such as live file lists (`vk`), easy sandboxing (`sand`) and quick uniq (`unik`), among many many others.

**Cralias Bio** is a set of useful terminal commands for biologists, featuring a sample sequence generator (`ranseq*`) and fasta file viewers (`flatfa`, `flal`, `flil`), among others.

Add `source /path/to/cralias/cralias*sh` to your `bashrc` to use cralias! Information on each individual alias and function is included in the comments of each file.
